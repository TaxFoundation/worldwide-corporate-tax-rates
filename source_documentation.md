## Sources/details on countries that are not part of the KPMG or OECD datasets or countries that changed their corporate tax rate in 2020 (rates apply to the year 2020 unless otherwise noted)

* **ALA - Aland Islands:** Corporate income tax rate of 20 percent, see Alands landskapsregering, "Beskattning av företag och samfund," updated on Feb. 7, 2018, https://www.regeringen.ax/ekonomi/skattesystemet/beskattning-foretag-samfund.

* **ANT - Netherlands Antilles:** In 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were split: Curaçao and St Maarten each became separate countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Islands of Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatia became special municipalities of the Netherlands. As a result, there is no corporate tax rate starting in 2010.

* **ARE	- United Arab Emirates:** The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven Emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al-Qaiwain, Ras Al-Khaimah, and Fujairah. Currently, the United Arab Emirates does not have a federal corporate income tax regime; however, most of the Emirates introduced income tax decrees in the late 1960s, and taxation is therefore determined on an Emirate-by-Emirate basis. Under the Emirate-based tax decrees, CIT may be imposed on all companies (including branches and permanent establishments) at rates of up to 55%. However, in practice, CIT is currently only enforced in respect of corporate entities engaged in the production of oil and gas or extraction of other natural resources in the United Arab Emirates, see PwC, "Worldwide Tax Summaries - Corporate - Taxes on corporate income - United Arab Emirates," https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/united-arab-emirates/corporate/taxes-on-corporate-income. As this dataset captures general corporate tax regimes, the United Arab Emirates' corporate tax rate is set to 0 for all years.

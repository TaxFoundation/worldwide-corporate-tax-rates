* **ABW - Aruba:** Corporate income tax rate of 22 percent down from 25 percent. Bloomberg Tax, "Country Guides - Corporate Tax Rates," accessed November 2023, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380.

* **AFG - Afghanistan:** Corporate income tax rate of 20 percent. Bloomberg Tax, "Country Guides - Corporate Tax Rates," accessed November 2023, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380.

* **ALA - Aland Islands:** Corporate income tax rate of 20 percent, see Alands landskapsregering, "Beskattning av företag och samfund," updated on Feb. 7, 2018, https://www.regeringen.ax/ekonomi/skattesystemet/beskattning-foretag-samfund and " YB Case Aland Islands", consulted Nov. 2023, https://ybcase.com/en/jurisdictions/alandskie-ostrova.

* **ANT - Netherlands Antilles:** In 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were split: Curaçao and St Maarten each became separate countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Islands of Bonaire, Saba and St Eustatia became special municipalities of the Netherlands. As a result, there is no corporate tax rate starting in 2010.

* **ARE	- United Arab Emirates:** The United Arab Emirates is a federation of seven Emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al-Qaiwain, Ras Al-Khaimah, and Fujairah. Currently, the United Arab Emirates does not have a federal corporate income tax regime; however, most of the Emirates introduced income tax decrees in the late 1960s, and taxation is therefore determined on an Emirate-by-Emirate basis. Under the Emirate-based tax decrees, CIT may be imposed on all companies (including branches and permanent establishments) at rates of up to 55PERCENT. In 2023, the United Arab Emirates introduced a federal corporate tax of 9 percent on taxable income above AED 375,000 (US$ 102,000). However, the new corporate income tax will not apply to the extraction of natural resources as these activities are already subject to taxation in the Emirates, see PwC, "Worldwide Tax Summaries - Corporate - Taxes on corporate income - United Arab Emirates," https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/united-arab-emirates/corporate/taxes-on-corporate-income.

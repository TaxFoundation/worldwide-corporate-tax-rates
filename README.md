# Corporate Tax Rates Around the World, 2019

The Tax Foundationâ€™s publication [Corporate Tax Rates Around the World](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/corporate-tax-rates-around-the-world/) shows how statutory corporate income tax rates have developed since 1980, with data for over 200 jurisdictions for the year 2019. The dataset we compiled for the years 1980 to 2019 is made available as a resource for research.

## The Dataset

### Scope
The dataset compiled for this publication includes the 2019 statutory corporate income tax rates of 218 sovereign states and dependent territories around the world. Tax rates were researched only for jurisdictions that are among the almost 250 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). As a result, zones or territories that are independent taxing jurisdictions but do not have their own country code are not included in the dataset.

In addition, the dataset includes historic statutory corporate income tax rates for the time period 1980 to 2018. However, these years cover tax rates of fewer than 218 jurisdictions due to missing data points.

To be able to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for 176 jurisdictions. When used to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates, either weighted by GDP or unweighted, only these 176 jurisdictions are included (to ensure the comparability of the unweighted and weighted averages).

### Definition of Selected Corporate Income Tax Rate
The dataset captures standard top statutory corporate income tax rates levied on domestic businesses. This means:
- The dataset does not reflect special tax regimes, including but not limited to patent boxes, offshore regimes, or special rates for specific industries. 
- A number of countries levy lower rates for businesses below a certain revenue threshold. The dataset does not capture these lower rates.
- A few countries levy gross revenue taxes on businesses instead of corporate income taxes. Since the tax rates of a corporate income tax and a gross revenue tax are not comparable, these countries are excluded from the dataset.

## Explanation of Files in Repository

### /main directory

Location of the R code, the source documentation, and this README.

The R code reads in and downloads the necessary data, cleans the data, adds missing data manually, merges datasets, and produces intermediate and final output datasets and tables.

The source documentation cites all the sources used.

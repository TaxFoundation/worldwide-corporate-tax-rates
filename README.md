# Corporate Tax Rates around the World, 2020

The Tax Foundationâ€™s publication [Corporate Tax Rates around the World](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/corporate-tax-rates-around-the-world/) shows how statutory corporate income tax rates have developed since 1980, with data for over 200 jurisdictions for the year 2022. The dataset we compiled for the years 1980 to 2022 is made available as a resource for research.

## The Dataset

### Scope
The dataset compiled for this publication includes the 2020 statutory corporate income tax rates of 223 sovereign states and dependent territories around the world. Tax rates were researched only for jurisdictions that are among the around 250 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). (The jurisdictions Netherland Antilles (which was split into different jurisdictions in 2010) and Kosovo (which has not yet officially been assigned a country code) were added to the dataset.) As a result, zones or territories that are independent taxing jurisdictions but do not have their own country code are generally not included in the dataset.

In addition, the dataset includes historic statutory corporate income tax rates for the time period 1980 to 2019. However, these years cover tax rates of fewer than 223 jurisdictions due to missing data points. Please let Tax Foundation know if you are aware of any sources for historic corporate tax rates that are not mentioned in this report, as we constantly strive to improve our datasets.

To be able to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for 177 jurisdictions. When used to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates, either weighted by GDP or unweighted, only these 177 jurisdictions are included (to ensure the comparability of the unweighted and weighted averages).


### Definition of Selected Corporate Income Tax Rate
The dataset captures *standard top statutory corporate income tax rates* levied on domestic businesses. This means:
- The dataset does not reflect special tax regimes, including but not limited to patent boxes, offshore regimes, or special rates for specific industries. 
- A number of countries levy lower rates for businesses below a certain revenue threshold. The dataset does not capture these lower rates.
- A few countries levy gross revenue taxes on businesses instead of corporate income taxes. Since the tax rates of a corporate income tax and a gross revenue tax are not comparable, these countries are excluded from the dataset.
- Some countries have a separate tax rate for nonresident companies. This dataset does not consider nonresident tax rates that differ from the general corporate rate.


## Explanation of Files in Repository

### /main directory

Location of the R code, the source documentation, and this README.

The R code reads in and downloads the necessary data, cleans the data, adds missing data manually, merges datasets, and produces intermediate and final output datasets and tables.

The source documentation cites all the sources used.

### /source-data

- `final_data_2022_gdp_incomplete.csv` Statutory corporate income tax rates and GDP levels of countries paired with ISO country codes, continents, and country groups for the year 2020. Includes all countries for which we have data for the corporate income tax rate, including countries for which we do not have GDP data.

- `final_data_long.csv` Statutory corporate income tax rates and GDP levels of all countries paired with ISO country codes, continents, and country groups for the years 1980 to 2020.

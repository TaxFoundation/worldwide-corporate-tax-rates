#Corporate Tax Rates Around the World, 2019

The Tax Foundationâ€™s publication [Corporate Tax Rates Around the World](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/corporate-tax-rates-around-the-world/) shows how statutory corporate income tax rates have developed since 1980, with data for over 200 jurisdictions for the year 2019. The dataset we compiled for the years 1980 to 2019 can be used as a resource for further research.

## Explanation of Files in Repository

### /main directory

Location of the R code, the source documentation, and this README.

The R code reads in and downloads the necessary data, cleans the data, adds missing data manually, merges datasets, and produces intermediate and final output datasets and tables.

The source documentation cites all the sources used.
